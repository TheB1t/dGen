dGen is a C-like programming language specifically designed for translation into SQF.

## Features and Advantages

1. **Simplification of Development**
	- **Abstraction**: dGen allows developers to write code at a higher level of abstraction, making it easier to create complex logic.
	- **C-like Syntax**: Since dGen uses a C-like syntax, developers familiar with C-style programming languages can adapt quickly and start working efficiently.
1. **Enhanced Functionality**
	- **Support for Structures**: Unlike SQF, dGen allows the use of structures, facilitating more organized and modular code.
	- **Additional Features**: dGen may offer features absent in SQF, such as error handling.
1. **Error Detection at the Translation Stage**
	- **Type Checking**: dGen can perform static type checking, helping to prevent runtime errors that might occur in SQF. This significantly eases debugging and improves code quality.
	- **Variable and Function Access Checks**: The ability to check the validity of variable and function access at compile time allows developers to find and fix errors more quickly.
1. **Integration with existing project**
	- **Easy Integration with SQF**: As dGen translates to SQF, developers can use it in existing projects without the need for a complete code rewrite.
1. **Optimizations**
	- **Performance Enhancements**: dGen can optimize the generated SQF code by analyzing the high-level abstractions and translating them into more efficient SQF constructs. This can lead to improved execution speed and reduced resource consumption in the final SQF code.
	- **Code Minification**: The translation process can include code minification techniques to reduce the size of the generated SQF files.
	- **Dead Code Elimination**: dGen can identify and eliminate unused code paths during the translation process, resulting in cleaner and more efficient SQF output.
